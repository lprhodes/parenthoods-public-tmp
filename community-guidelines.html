                    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
<p>Parenthoods is a community platform for local parents to meet up, share advice, and help each other conquer one of life’s most craziest rides…parenthood.</p>
<h4>Be Polite &amp; Supportive</h4>
<p>Any posts or comments that do not uphold the communities tenants of being safe, supportive and encouraging may be removed.</p>
<p><b>Good<br>
</b>Don’t pile on the guilt! Recognize and applaud parents and suggest some alternative options for them to try.</p>
<p>For example: “These things worked for me…”</p>
<p><b>Harmful<br>
</b>Remember there are many different ways to raise a child. If you find it difficult to be supportive to a fellow member, please don’t say anything at all.</p>
<p>For example, avoid comments like: “I would never do that…” OR “You’re doing it wrong, do this…”</p>
<p>We do not allow bullying, harassment, personal attacks, violence, or people deliberately disrupting the community.</p>
